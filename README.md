# Sequence-Test

Here you can find some test scripts to segment a certain part over an image sequence (with an initialization)

DoP_histograms : script to evaluate visually (with histograms) the consistency (in value) of DoP images for thresholding
blob_test : a test script to evaluate the performance of a blob detector for tracking a certain part (does not give godd results)
featurepoint_matching : Test script of an estimation of homogeneous matrix between 2 images
regiongrowing : Region growing algorithm for segmentation
seqtoolbox : some functions useful for the final treatment
test3d : script to visualize with a 3d plot a gradient estimation
test_hog : test script to evaluate the performances of HOG to solve the problem
test_sequence : main test file. Implements the latest solution found.
